# What is this?
This is my pure pursuit controller integration for a car model. 
It also comes with visualization publishers for Foxglove/ Rviz, so that the road taken and the desired road can be visualized. Also, the controller is written on C for better performance.
I also have developed some tools for the race lines while creating them, you can find them in there. 


# How do I use it?
Well, this package is probably not perfectly suited for you use case. You should change different parts of the code, like publishers and subscribers, roads, and maybe even the algorithm logic slightly. But this repository will definetly help and guide you along the way if you want to solve the problem of control in your autonomous system.
