# What is this?
This is my pure pursuit controller integration for a car model. 
- It comes with visualization publishers for Foxglove/ Rviz, so that the road taken and the desired road can be visualized.
- Also, the controller is written on C for better performance.
- I also have developed some tools in the creation and arrangement of race lines for the algorithm, you can find them in there. 


# How do I use it?
Well, this package is probably not perfectly suited for you use case. You should change or further develop different parts of the code, like publishers and subscribers, integration with a path planning algorithm and maybe even the controller logic (just) slightly. But this repository will definetly help and guide you along the way if you want to solve the problem of control in your autonomous system. I can say that I'd definitely love to see such a repo while I was working on the project myself.
